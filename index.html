                        <p>While I have been working as a developer at IAG, I have improved my skills in HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I have had personal mentoring from other developers at IAG, covering all the relevent languges as they came up in the work we were doing. Specifically we looked at JavaScript as I felt it was something I could really improve on, and it would give me the ability to do some really fun and interesting things. Recently we began looking at JQuery which I have continued to learn through my own research and practice.</p>
                        <p>During my education I was taught basic programming using python and have since used it in most papers, so I consider it one of my strongest programming languages. I learned the basics of a lot of languages including Java, C, C#, F#, SQL, VisualBasic and even assembly language. I also have experience using packet tracer, imageJ and database programs.</p>

I have always enjoyed really creative photography and using interesting techniques such as using coloured lights, macro photography and post production manipulation to name a few. Through school I learned to use photoshop, and in my own time I spent hours experimenting and researching different things that can be done with it.</p>

                                <p>At Zara, I worked with a big team of people. I often had to work to complete tasks as a group, and other times I worked independently, always to strict time targets. Quite often, I had to decide on my own how to complete a task in the most efficient way, or to organize and delegate jobs to others. I worked in almost every aspect of the store, from customer service on the shop floor, to unpacking and processing deliveries in the stockroom.

                                At smaller events I have gone by myself to do all the photos. At events like balls I have worked in a team of two or three. Although most jobs were for events, I also did some other types of photography like interior design.</p>
