                        <p>I would love to work in a job where I can explore front end programming, web development and web design. I am looking to expand my knowledge and build my skills in front end development or full stack. I have recently finished studying computer science at the University of Auckland, and have been working as a junior front end developer at IAG since July, 2018. I am eager to learn about all aspects of development, although I have a particular interest in front end development.</p>

                        <p>While I have been working as a developer at IAG, I have improved my skills in HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I have had personal mentoring from other developers at IAG, covering some of the relevant languages as they came up in the work we were doing. We looked specifically at JavaScript as I felt it was something I could really improve on, and it would give me the ability to do some really fun and interesting things. Recently we began looking at JQuery which I have continued to learn through my own research and practice, and I have started looking into JavaScript frameworks such as Vue, React and Angular. During my education, I was taught basic programming using python and have since used it in most papers, so I consider it one of my strongest programming languages. I learned the basics of many languages including Java, C, C#, F#, SQL, VisualBasic and even assembly language. I also have educational experience using packet tracer, imageJ and database management programs.</p>

                        <p>I discovered my enthusiasm for photography during high school where I took photography for 2 years. I have always enjoyed very creative photography and using interesting techniques such as using coloured lights, macro photography and post production manipulation to name a few. At school, I learned to use Photoshop and in my own time I spent hours experimenting and researching different things that can be done with it. I have recently started experimenting with basic video creation which I find uses a lot of the same skills.</p>

                                    At Zara, I worked with a big team of people. I often had to work to complete tasks as a group, and other times I worked independently, always to strict time targets. Quite often, I had to decide on my own how to complete a task in the most efficient way, or to organize and delegate jobs to others. I worked in almost every aspect of the store, from customer service on the shop floor, to unpacking and processing deliveries in the stockroom.
