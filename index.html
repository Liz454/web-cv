                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>While I have been working as a developer at IAG, I have improved my skills in HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I have had personal mentoring from other developers at IAG, covering all the relevent languges as they came up in the work we were doing. Specifically we looked at JavaScript as I felt it was something I could really improve on, and it would give me the ability to do some really fun and interesting things. Recently we began looking at JQuery which I have continued to learn through my own research and practice.</p>
                    <p>During my education I was taught basic programming using python and have since used it in most papers, so I consider it one of my strongest programming languages. I learned the basics of a lot of languages including Java, C, C#, F#, SQL, VisualBasic and even assembly language. I also have experience using packet tracer, imageJ and database programs.</p>

                    <p>I discovered my enthusiasm for photography during highschool where I took photography for 2 years. I have always enjoyed really creative photography and using interesting techniques such as using coloured lights, macro photography and post production manipulation to name a few. Through school I learned to use photoshop, and in my own time I spent hours experimenting and researching different things that can be done with it.</p>

                    <p>I have worked for about two years in customer service jobs. I enjoyed working in large teams of people and having the opportunity to work in different aspects of the store. Working in the stockroom at Zara involved a lot of organization and problem solving to make the most of the space we had available. Interacting with customers in the store required keeping a friendly demeanour at all times and being able to work efficiently to make time for every customer that needs help.</p>

                            <p>At IAG I have worked on the AMI, State and NZI websites.

                            <p>Sales assistant | December 2016 â€“ July 2018</p>
                            <p>At Zara, I worked with a big team of people. I often had to work to complete tasks as a group, and other times I worked independently, always to strict time targets. Quite often, I had to decide on my own how to complete a task in the most efficient way, or to organize and delegate jobs to others. I worked in almost every aspect of the store, from customer service on the shop floor, to unpacking and processing deliveries in the stockroom.
