                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>Throughout my time working as a front-end developer I have improved my skills in html, javascript and css. I have also gained more knowledge about the process of building a website. During my education I have used Python, Java, C, HTML, CSS, SQL, OpenGL, VisualBasic and various other programming languages. I also have experience using packet tracer, imageJ and database programs. My strongest languages are html, css, JavaScript and python (which I have used it for assignments and writing code every semester at university).</p>
                <h3>Customer service</h3>
                <p>I have worked for about two years in customer service jobs. I am  empathetic and I am happy to take the time to help customers find exactly what they need. </p>
                <h3>Photography</h3>
                <p>Photography has given me a good eye for artistic design which helps with designing and formatting programs and web pages.
                At school I learned to use Photoshop, and through my own research and extensive use I became skilled at doing unique and creative manipulations.

                            <p>At Zara, I worked with a big team of people. I often had to work to complete tasks as a group, and other times I worked independently, always to strict time targets. Quite often, I had to decide on my own how to complete a task in the most efficient way, or to organize and delegate jobs to others. I worked in almost every aspect of the store, from customer service on the shop floor, to unpacking and processing deliveries in the stockroom.
